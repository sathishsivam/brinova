  <h2 style="color:red"> Software Development Practice</h2>
 <br>
 <P> 
  Software Industry is a rapidly evolving industry. Due to the demand and existing gaps in the market, the competition is high. Hence there are many companies trying to develop their own solutions to get a piece of the pie.
  
  Studies indicate that over 80% of software development projects are unsuccessful due to wrong foresight, poor execution, budget and resource constraints or incorrect functionality. Unfortunately, a lot of dedicated efforts in software industry go waste. 
  
  Learning from the approach employed and practicing help us in ensuring successful software development. In software development, Upgradation, Enterprise Integration or Maintenance, we approach with the best practices given below

  <ul>
     <li> Recruit the Right Resources</li>
     <li> Select the Right Development Process</li>
     <li> Make Sound Estimations</li>
     <li> Define Smaller Milestones</li>
     <li> Define Complete Requirements </li>
     <li> Define System Architecture</li>
     <li> Optimize Design</li>
     <li> Effective Code Implementation</li>

    Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto.</p>


<p style="font-size:15px"> Brinova , In Consultation with the owner of the product , our development team segregate the work to be completed into work scripts. Each of these work scripts is expected to issue, once implemented, a contribution to the value of the overall product, irrespective of the order of implementation; these and other assumptions as to the nature of scripts are captured by Us in a reputed approach.
</p>

<p style="font-size:15px">

For most Agile teams scripts are the main vehicle of incremental software delivery, and offer the merits
transferring the risks of delayed feedback, all the more so
if the work flows are small
if the software is released to production frequently
for the customer or product owner, the option to change their mind on the details or the schedule priority of any user story not yet implemented
for developers, being given clear and precise acceptance criteria, and ongoing feedback as they complete work
promoting a clear separation of responsibilities between defining the "what" (province of the customer or product owner) and the "how" (province of the technical team), leveraging the skills and creativity of each
